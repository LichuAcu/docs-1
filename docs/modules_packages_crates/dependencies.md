# Dependencies

Nargo allows you to upload packages to GitHub and use them as dependencies.

## Specifying a dependency

```
hello_world = { tag = "v0.5", git = "https://github.com/kevaundray/hello-world-noir"}
```

Specifying a dependency requires a tag to a specific commit and the git url to the url containing the package.

Currently, there are no requirements on the tag contents. If requirements are added, it would follow semver 2.0 guidelines.

> Note: Without a `tag` , there would be no versioning and dependencies would change each time you compile your project.
