title: Coming Soon - Learn about Isize and Recursion in Circuits
description:
  Get ready to learn about the partially supported signed integers such as i32 and i64 and the
  native support for recursion in circuits in Noir, coming soon.

# Isize

Signed integers such as i32 and i64 allow one to express more circuits. They are partially supported
but need to be finalised.

# Recursion

Recursion is becoming feasible in circuits, hence Noir will have native support for it. Currently,
only composition is supported.
