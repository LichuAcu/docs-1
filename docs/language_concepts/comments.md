# Comments

A comment is a line in your codebase which the compiler ignores, however it can be read by programmers.

Here is a single line comment:

```rust,noplaypen
// This is a comment and is ignored
```

`//` is used to tell the compiler to ignore the rest of the line.

Noir doesn't have multi-line comments, but you can emulate them via using `//` on each line

```rust,noplaypen
// This is a multi line
// comment, that is ignored by 
// the compiler
```
